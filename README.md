# sorting-pagination-caching
Hi in this I have implemented pagination, caching and sorting 
Why we use this we may have larger datasets it will be hard to use them with out proper sorting and pagination, with the help of these we can sort our data.
Caching is done to improve the performance because it will hard for the system to every time call database we can use caching and store cache data on cache memory and we acn use it.
